THESE ARE MERELY SUGGESTIONS, DO WITH THEM AS YOU WILL!

Overall: Possible to keep character name visible on the top all the time?

Character:
- Capitolize "take damage" to match "Heal HP"

Spells tab:
- When "Close all Spells" clicked, minimize all spell lists internally
- Maybe make Close All a "-" button with tooltip for Close all?  Not sure if better/worse, just a thought
- Saving Throw section is a bit confusing 
- Not sure spell level is needed within the spell window itself? If want it, maybe deliniate it more, like put it into a small box?
- Damage types not shown with dice breakdown
- Nitpick: is it possible to keep the "Close all" displayed all the time?
- Personal pet peeve: Should capitolize the second part of spell components ("Casting Time: Action" instead of "..: action")

Skills tab:
- Advantage/Disadvantage: checkboxes instead of buttons with just "Advantage"/"Disadvantage" instead of full text
XXX- Separate the final roll into a highlighted box so easier to read? Not sure on that one

Level Up tab: 
- Close all option?
Xx- Some sections have ";" at end of button and some dont. Not sure what's going on there?
XXX- Play around with sizing of text fields, could get more real estate/less white space
- Adjust skills, not sure you need "not prof-prof..." under EVER section, maybe just at the top like a column header?
XXX- "Open New Character Creator" slightly larger than others when collapsed
XXX- New spell tool section buttons are a bit large compared to the rest of the tab
- New spell, change Spell Level to dropdown, possible for Casting Time as well (more variability with that though)
- When using "confirm" windows, put object name in quotes, or have a "-" after the confirm to separate
XXX- Move Character Load/Delete to the bottom of the page, as it shouldnt be used as much (or maybe delete at the bottom and load at the top?)
